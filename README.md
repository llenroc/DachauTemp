# DachauTemp
This is a sample demo application that I use to collect the current temperature and humidity data in my apartment in Dachau (Germany) to collect them in the cloud.

# Setup
I use a Raspberry Pi 3 running [Windows 10 IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot) connected with the [GHI Electronics FEZ Hat](https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/500)
